<p align="center">A feature-rich dashboard for SimHub</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/meltyfruits/meltydash/blob/main/meltydash/meltydash.djson.png?raw=true" alt="menuscreen"/></p>

### Features
* Dynamically shows in-car adjustment cards based on what that car has available, i.e., if throttle shape is available, the throttle shape card will be visible.
* Shows a popup when an in-car setting is changed for your specified delay in the settings file. I'm happy to say that this isn't done with layers and will ***always*** show the last updated in-car setting.
* After crossing the start/finish line, last lap's delta to the session best will be held briefly. The amount of time it holds for can be customised in the settings.
* Low fuel warning displays by default at 10% remaining fuel. The threshold can be customised in the settings. Additionally, the orientation of the alert can be changed to vertical or horizontal.
* Pit limiter screen will show a red background if the pit limiter is engaged while outside of pit lane. It will show a green background while in pit lane.
* Multiple colour themes.
* Default theme consists of thoughtfully chosen PANTONEÂ®-based colours.
