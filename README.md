### Features
* Dynamically shows in-car adjustment cards based on what that car has available, i.e., if throttle shape is available, the throttle shape card will be visible.
* Shows a popup when an in-car setting is changed for your specified delay in the settings file. I'm happy to say that this isn't done with layers and will ***always*** show the last updated in-car setting.
* Low fuel warning at your specified percent via the settings file.
* Multiple colour themes.
* Default theme consists of thoughtfully chosen PANTONEÂ®-based colours.
